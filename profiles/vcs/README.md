# VCS profile

This profile builds `VCSNative.exe` for the supported GTA: Vice City Stories PSP executable. It contains the title-specific generated AOT corpus, HLE/profile code, DX12 renderer integration, audio/input support and configuration required by the current native build.

## Quick build on Windows

Run `BUILD_VCS.bat` from this directory for the normal performance build. Generated AOT stays at the maximum MSVC optimization level with AVX2, compiler `/MP`, MSBuild `/m` and persistent incremental objects. Host/runtime code may use whole-program optimization, but the 234 generated AOT translation units are explicitly compiled with `/GL-` so the final linker does not have to hold the entire generated corpus as LTCG IR. The current runtime fast paths remain enabled.

`BUILD_VCS_FAST.bat` remains the corresponding fast incremental pipeline: generated AOT at O2 with LTCG disabled. No separate experimental max-performance build is used.

The launchers automatically locate CMake from PATH, Visual Studio 2022 (including the bundled CMake component), `vswhere`, or a standard standalone CMake installation. `BUILD_VCS_FAST.bat` remains the quickest development/debug-oriented build.

For the single-configuration Ninja workflow used during incremental renderer and
generated-code development, see [`../../docs/VCS_NINJA_BUILD.md`](../../docs/VCS_NINJA_BUILD.md).

## Supported executable

The profile targets the ULUS-10160 PSP release currently used by the generated corpus. No EBOOT or commercial game asset is included.

## Prepare local game data

The runtime expects a decrypted ELF and the game's `PSP_GAME/USRDIR` data from your own copy. This repository does not include decryption code.

Use:

```powershell
.\profiles\vcs\tools\prepare_game.ps1 `
  -ExtractedUmdRoot D:\VCS_EXTRACTED `
  -DecryptedElf D:\local\EBOOT_DECRYPTED.ELF
```

The default destination is `profiles/vcs/game`, which is ignored by Git.

## Build on Windows

Fast development build:

```text
profiles\vcs\scripts\build_fast.bat
```

Optimized release build:

```text
profiles\vcs\scripts\build_release.bat
```

Run with the default local game directory:

```text
profiles\vcs\scripts\play.bat
```

Or pass a game root explicitly:

```text
profiles\vcs\scripts\play.bat D:\VCS_GAME_ROOT
```

For an uncapped CPU/GE measurement, use `profiles\vcs\scripts\bench.bat`.

### Windows link memory

The generated VCS corpus is intentionally excluded from MSVC whole-program IR in the normal release build. Later AOT cross-unit optimizations make whole-program analysis of all generated units unnecessarily expensive in linker memory. This does not disable per-unit `/Ox`; it only prevents those generated units from being deferred to link-time code generation. Host/runtime LTCG remains available, and the release linker prints LTCG status while it runs.

## Build and run on Linux

The VCS host is Windows/DX12 code, so on Linux the Windows executable is
cross-compiled with clang-cl and run through Proton (vkd3d-proton provides DX12).

1. Fetch the MSVC CRT and Windows SDK headers/libraries with
   [xwin](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin). This requires accepting the
   Microsoft license:

   ```bash
   xwin --accept-license --arch x86_64 splat --output ~/.xwin
   ```

2. Configure and build (`clang-cl`, `lld-link`, `llvm-rc`, `llvm-lib` and
   `llvm-mt` from LLVM must be on `PATH`):

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B out/vcs-win -G Ninja \
     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/clangcl-xwin.cmake \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPSPRECOMP_PROFILE=vcs \
     -DPSPRECOMP_GENERATED_OPT_LEVEL=3 -DPSPRECOMP_LTO=OFF -DPSPRECOMP_NATIVE_AVX2=ON \
     -DPSPRECOMP_AOT_ASSUME_NO_WRITE_WATCH=ON -DPSPRECOMP_AOT_PRODUCTION_FASTPATHS=ON \
     -DPSPRECOMP_MSVC_MP_JOBS=1 -DPSPRECOMP_PROFILE_GUIDED_AOT=ON \
     -DPSPRECOMP_HOT_GENERATED_OPT_LEVEL=3 -DPSPRECOMP_GENERATED_INLINE_LEVEL=0 \
     -DPSPRECOMP_HOT_GENERATED_INLINE_LEVEL=3 -DPSPRECOMP_VCS_AOT_LTO=OFF \
     -DPSPRECOMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DPSPRECOMP_BUILD_PROFILE_TESTS=OFF
   ninja -C out/vcs-win -j8 VCSNative
   ```

   Each generated AOT unit needs roughly 1 GB of RAM at `/O3`; lower `-j` on
   machines with less than 16 GB.

3. Prepare `profiles/vcs/game` as described above, then run:

   ```bash
   profiles/vcs/scripts/play_proton.sh [GAME_ROOT]
   ```

   It mirrors `play.bat` (every `PSPRECOMP_*` switch can be overridden from the
   environment) and uses Proton 10.0 from the Steam library by default (`PROTON`
   selects another). `PSPRECOMP_DX12_PACKED_0115` defaults to `0` here: the packed
   0x0115 GPU decode produces exploded geometry under vkd3d-proton.

`PSPRECOMP_STDERR_FILE=<windows path>` writes the runtime's stderr diagnostics
(`[audio-host]`, `[atrac]`, `[realtime-speed]`, ...) to a file, since a GUI
executable has no console and Proton discards the stream.

## Resolution configuration

`profiles/vcs/config/VCSNative.ini` exposes both the presentation resolution and the internal render resolution.

`[Display] ResolutionMode` accepts `PSP`, `Desktop` or `Custom`. `Custom` uses `Width` and `Height`. With `Fullscreen=true`, VCSNative uses a borderless desktop-sized window; custom width/height still define the logical output surface used by the presentation/widescreen configuration.

`[Rendering] InternalResolutionMode` accepts `PSP`, `Scale`, `Desktop` or `Custom`. `Scale` uses `InternalScale`; `Custom` uses `InternalWidth` and `InternalHeight`. These settings control the native render target independently from the presentation window.

## Regenerate VCS AOT code

The VCS profile keeps an address-aware generator target separate from the generic framework generator:

```text
vcs_recomp
```

Its source lives in `profiles/vcs/tools/vcs_codegen_main.cpp`. Profile-only lowering and measured native leaves belong there or under `host/`; they do not belong in the root PSPRecomp generator/runtime.

## Development history

Old stage reports, validation notes and handoffs are stored under `profiles/vcs/progress`. That directory is intentionally ignored by the repository so development history does not pollute the public source tree.
